Subject: [PATCH 15/37] mach-zynqmp/spl.c: Remove 1-second delay at boot

SPL boot is slow on the zynqMP because of this delay. The initialization done
in psu_init no longer requires an external delay, so this can be removed to
speed up the SPL boot flow considerably.

This causes the SD card boot to fail, so when boot mode is set to SD card,
delay for 1s to work around this.
