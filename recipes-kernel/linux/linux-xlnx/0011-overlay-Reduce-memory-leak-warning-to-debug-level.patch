Subject: [PATCH 11/14] overlay: Reduce memory leak warning to debug level

The kernel spams messages like:
  OF: overlay: WARNING: memory leak will occur if overlay removed, property: /fpga-full/firmware-name
This issue was present in previous kernels but was never reported
explicitly. There's nothing "we" can do about it at the moment, so
reduce the log level and keep the spam out of the error level logs.
