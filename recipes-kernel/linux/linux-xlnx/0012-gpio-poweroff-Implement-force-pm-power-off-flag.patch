Subject: [PATCH 12/14] gpio-poweroff: Implement force-pm-power-off flag

Implement a devicetree property to forcibly set the pm_power_off variable.

Some drivers, most noticably PCSI, implement a pm_power_off call even though it
cannot possibly work, and they do so unconditionally. To provide a means of
overriding the power-off behavior of a system, allow this driver to replace
the pm_power_off call, also unconditionally.
